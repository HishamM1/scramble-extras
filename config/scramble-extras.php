    | whenever the source file's mtime changes.

    | disabled while actively iterating on Data classes locally.

    |
    | Scramble core only ever documents the FIRST HTTP method a route responds
    | to. Route::apiResource()'s update action registers both PUT and PATCH on
    | a single Route, so PATCH silently never gets documented. When enabled,
    | every method the route actually responds to (except HEAD/OPTIONS) gets
    | its own operation.
    |
    | This isn't Spatie-specific - it fixes documentation for both Data-typed
    | and Resource-typed actions alike. Disable it if your app already
    | registers its own Scramble::configure()->resolveOperationMethodsUsing()
    | and you don't want this package to take precedence (whichever call runs
    | last wins; your own AppServiceProvider boots after package providers, so
    | it already wins by default - this toggle is only for the rare case where
    | you'd rather this package not touch it at all).
