## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- **422 for `Data`-typed actions.** A controller action type-hinted with a
  `Data` class is resolved and validated by Laravel exactly like a
  `FormRequest` would be, but core Scramble only checked for `FormRequest`
  when deciding whether to document a `422` response. Mirrors core's own
  `ErrorResponsesExtension` handling.
- **`PATCH` documented alongside `PUT`.** Scramble's default route-methods
  resolver only documents the first HTTP method a route responds to, so
  `Route::apiResource()`'s update action (registered for both `PUT` and
  `PATCH` on one Route) only ever produced a `put` operation. Opt out with
  `SCRAMBLE_EXTRAS_EXPAND_ROUTE_METHODS=false` /
  `scramble-extras.expand_route_methods`. Requires a `dedoc/scramble` version
  with `GeneratorConfig::resolveOperationMethodsUsing()` (added after this
  package's 0.13.0 floor); on older installs this feature is a no-op rather
  than an error.

### Fixed
- **`PaginatedDataCollection`/`CursorPaginatedDataCollection`/`DataCollection`
  response envelopes were empty when the item type came from a spec-correct,
  two-argument generic docblock** (`PaginatedDataCollection<int, ProductData>`,
  matching spatie/laravel-data's own `<TKey of array-key, TValue>` template
  declaration, mirroring `Illuminate\Support\Collection`). The three
  `*TypeToSchemaExtension` classes always read the item type off
  `templateTypes[0]`, which only holds it in the single-template shape
  Scramble's flow inference produces from a bare `Data::collect()` call with
  no docblock; `TValue` is the *last* template parameter, not the first.
- Stale test assertion against a `dedoc/scramble` `Type::toArray()` shape
  that changed between patch releases within this package's `^0.13.0` range
  (scalar `example` key on 0.13.0, folded into the plural `examples` list on
  later 0.13.x) — the underlying `SchemaAttributeApplier` behavior was never
  wrong, only the test's expectation of a fixed output shape.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-12

### Changed
- **Require `dedoc/scramble ^0.13`** (previously `^0.12.20`). The full test
  suite (60 tests) passes unchanged against Scramble 0.13.27, so no extension
  code needed to change. The 0.12 line is dropped to avoid maintaining
  compatibility shims across two diverging internal-API versions; projects
  still on Scramble 0.12 should stay on scramble-extras 0.2.x.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- Publishable `config/scramble-extras.php` with `cache.enabled` and `cache.path`
  options (also settable via `SCRAMBLE_EXTRAS_CACHE` / `SCRAMBLE_EXTRAS_CACHE_PATH`).
- Full test suite: unit tests for the attribute → OpenAPI applier, query-builder
  AST extraction, schema cache, support types, and return-type inference, plus an
  end-to-end Scramble generation test booted with `orchestra/testbench`.
- GitHub Actions CI matrix across PHP 8.2 / 8.3 / 8.4 and lowest/stable dependencies,
  plus a CI status badge in the README.

### Changed
- Test suite uses `#[Test]` attributes instead of the `test` method-name prefix.
  Dev tooling allows `phpunit/phpunit ^11.5 || ^12.0`: PHP 8.3+ runs on PHPUnit 12,
  while PHP 8.2 (still a supported runtime) runs on PHPUnit 11, which is the last
  line that supports PHP 8.2.

### Changed
- **Request bodies are now inlined** instead of `$ref`-ing a shared component.
  When a `Data` class is used as both a response and a request body, the input
  and output projections differ (`#[Computed]`, `#[Hidden]`, `Optional`,
  `#[MapInputName]`); sharing a component name made the request body describe the
  output shape. Response schemas remain reusable `$ref` components.
- `SchemaCache` writes are deferred and flushed once on shutdown rather than
  rewritten on every schema build, and the cache file now carries a signature
  derived from the installed Scramble version so it self-invalidates after an
  upgrade.

### Fixed
- Use `Response::description()` instead of `Response::setDescription()` on
  paginated/cursor responses; `setDescription()` does not exist on Scramble
  0.12.20 (the declared minimum), so generation crashed on older-but-supported
  Scramble versions. The `^0.12.20` floor is now actually honored.
- Extracted `QueryBuilderUsageVisitor` into its own file for PSR-4 compliance.
- Removed unused imports.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- Initial release: Spatie Laravel Data (input/output schemas), all Spatie
  validation attributes, paginated/cursor/plain Data collections, Spatie Laravel
  Query Builder parameter extraction, and a persistent schema cache.
